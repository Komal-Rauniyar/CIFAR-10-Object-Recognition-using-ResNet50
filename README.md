# CIFAR-10-Object-Recognition-using-ResNet50

This project involves using a ResNet50 model to perform object recognition on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, with 6,000 images per class. The dataset is split into 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images. ResNet50, a deep convolutional neural network, is known for its strong performance on image recognition tasks due to its unique residual learning framework.

<h3>Key Components:</h3>

1.CIFAR-10 Dataset:

Classes: The dataset contains images categorized into 10 classes: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, and truck.
Image Size: Each image is 32x32 pixels with three color channels (RGB).

2.ResNet50 Architecture:

Layers: ResNet50 has 50 layers, including convolutional layers, batch normalization layers, activation layers, and fully connected layers.
Residual Blocks: Utilizes residual blocks with skip connections to mitigate the vanishing gradient problem, enabling training of very deep networks.

<h3>Project Steps:</h3>

1.Data Preparation:

Loading Data: Import the CIFAR-10 dataset and split it into training and test sets.
Data Augmentation: Apply transformations such as random cropping, flipping, and normalization to enhance the model's generalization capability.

2.Model Building:

Pre-trained Weights: Initialize ResNet50 with weights pre-trained on ImageNet, which can be fine-tuned for CIFAR-10.
Modifying the Network: Replace the top layer of ResNet50 to match the number of classes in CIFAR-10 (10 classes).

3.Training:

Loss Function: Use categorical cross-entropy as the loss function.
Optimizer: Employ an optimizer like Adam or SGD with an appropriate learning rate.
Training Process: Train the model on the augmented training data, monitor performance on a validation set, and apply techniques such as learning rate decay or early stopping.

4.Evaluation:

Accuracy: Evaluate the model on the test set to determine its accuracy in recognizing objects.
Confusion Matrix: Generate a confusion matrix to analyze the model's performance across different classes.

5.Fine-Tuning and Optimization:

Hyperparameter Tuning: Experiment with different hyperparameters, such as learning rates, batch sizes, and data augmentation strategies, to optimize performance.
Regularization: Apply techniques like dropout or L2 regularization to prevent overfitting.
